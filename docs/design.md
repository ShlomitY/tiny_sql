# TinySQL â€“ Build Your Own In-Memory Database in C++


I Started by opening a git repository and arranging the folders as suggested.
Then opened the suggested learning sources and decided to start by following the instructions 
in the third link that teaches how to implement a SQLite.
After completing the first 4 stages it blocked the learning option and asked for a membership so 
I decided to leave it for now and continue to the second link with the videos.
